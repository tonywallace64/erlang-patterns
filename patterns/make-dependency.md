Name:    Make Dependency
Scope:   Development Pattern
Summary: There are 4 components to this pattern, source files, a parsed file, a make file and a parser.  The parser converts a set of source files to a parsed version.  The parsed version will usually (but not neccesarily) have a different syntactical construction to the source files.  The parsed version will be semantically identical the source files.  The make file documents the dependency, and the parser does the transformation.  This pattern has several advantages.  (1) The make system detects when there have been changes to source files.  (2) The make system has rules to convert source files to the parsed version.  (3)  This pattern automates the system build process.  (4) This pattern ensures that defined automated checks are performed.  (5) This pattern documents the dependencies between components of the system.
